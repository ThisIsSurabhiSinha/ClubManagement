        Trendles
Knowledge Lies where Cognizance Prevails

“When the first wheel ever was rotated on its axis,
the revolution that followed never dared to stop.
We maintain the wheel's perpetuity of motion,
for time along with effort, converts a seed to crop.”

Expectations, whether big or small, are an intrinsic part of our lives. Whether it's the ones we have from our parents or the ones we have from a pizza, their gratification means a lot to us. So when students join our college, they arrive on our doorstep with an image of how they are vs how they want to be. Ensuring these expectations are fulfilled, is what the Trendles club aims at accomplishing, along with passing on the knowledge of the extent to what can be accomplished. It organizes and promotes various personality building activities and provides enough avenues under multiple domains to students in order to facilitate the pursuit of their dreams. Monitoring the activities outside of college and coordinating with other clubs to ensure that the best in the world is added to the personal experience portfolio of students, is another important part of Trendles’ job. It also ensures that not just success, but all the interesting stories from this journey are recorded, well-documented, and easily available for the whole world to see, through literary and photographic medium (Nirhaar: Annual Magazine). Inspiring, encouraging, guiding and motivating budding talents, and then watching as they blossom into epitomes of success, is a sentiment that is well-admired and shared among all members of Trendles. After all, a trendle is a wheel that keeps on moving, just like our lives; and only with the thread of awareness being spun on the trendle, can the fabric of knowledge be woven.

The confluence of creativity and cultures was a breathtaking sight to observe. Apart from the participation in a plethora of activities, students also got first-hand experience of event-management, and they also got enough creative space to explore the cultural avenues in unconventional ways. Needless to say, the ‘Wildbeats’ is paramount to the existence of IIIT Kottayam and its student life, and it will continue to sing the melody that its name signifies.
